Today felt like a good day to start working on Rocks' base projectile weapon. It can fire pretty fast, but has less accuracy and damage.
<br /><br />
Our collision system is working great, handling the projectile collisions without any changes. Also making a debut in this post is Rocks ability to Wall-cling and Wall-jump.
<br /><br />
Be prepared to use those abilities a lot in Rock Kickass.
