Yep, we've actually been hard at work in the months since our last post.
<br /><br />
The most obvious thing first: we changed the art style and redesigned Rock. The amount of effort required by the previous art style (which used 64x64 sprites) was a lot more than I could handle.
<br /><br />
Also, it was too detailed. I would get sort of lost in the design of characters and tiles, spending hours fretting over dithering and shades. The new sprites we're using are 32x32 and are much less detailed (thow I'm able to put more effort into animations, as you can see).
<br /><br />
Changing the art style is just one of the changes we've been working really hard on, but I'll elaborate on the others in future posts. It's super late here and I kinda want to just publish this and get some sleep :D
