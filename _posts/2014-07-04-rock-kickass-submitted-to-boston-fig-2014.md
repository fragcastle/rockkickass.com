We've submitted Rock Kickass to The 2014 [Boston Festival of Indie Games](http://bostonfig.com/ "The Boston Festival of Indie Games") (Boston FIG)!

> "The Boston Festival of Indie Games celebrates independent game development in New England and neighboring regions..."

It's September 13, 2014 at the MIT Johnson Athletic Center in Boston, MA.  We're still hard at work, so if we get accepted and you can make it to Boston FIG you'll see an even better version of Rock Kickass!
