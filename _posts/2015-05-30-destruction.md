We want Rock Kickass to be a game full of surprises and challenges. We don't really want the player to feel safe, or have them think they can take a breath whenever they want.

<br /><br />

So, we worked on getting some destructible terrain and "drop tiles" added into the game!

<br /><br />

What do you think?
