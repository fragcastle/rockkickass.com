So, now Crusher tosses spikes when he's not busy trying to run you down. And I played around a bit with a closed room boss fight. Things still left to do:
<br /><br />

 - Crusher needs a "I'm totally throwing spikes at you" animation
 - also, he feels too damage resistant, I'll want to play around with his damage resistance.
 - the lab tiles are in need of some TLC.
