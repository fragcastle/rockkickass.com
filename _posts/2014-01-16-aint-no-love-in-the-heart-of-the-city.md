New in this update is a city background tile on top of our wonderful mountains that were there before. Wow, I just got a wicked Bob Ross feeling... we'll just put a nice little shrub over here... for our woodland friends to live in. Okay, enough of that.
<br /><br />
The constant shakey cam has been removed. It made the level feel like you were riding on a train - the blocky tiles don't help, but hey, thats for another day. Instead, the level will move up or down so simulate the rising/falling of a plane in flight.
<br /><br />
The bubble-gun bug has been fixed, but you'll have to take our word for it ;)
<br /><br />
Until next time!
