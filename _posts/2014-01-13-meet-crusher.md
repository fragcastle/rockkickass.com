Crusher is the first boss encountered in Rock Kickass. He's made out of solid gold so he can take a ton of damage and packs a punch when he hits Rock. Definitely a boss you'll want to dodge.

Crusher also has some nasty steel spikes on his shoulder that he'll fire off after he charges. Be careful and quick on the jump and shoot buttons and you should survive.
